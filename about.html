                        <p>
                            I have been very passionate about computers since I was in middle school, I used to tinker with my aunts old laptop
                            which only worked when plugged in; in nigeria, the electricity supply is really bad, I could only use the laptop for
                            a few hours.<br>
                            During the lockdown,I found out of a way to increase my instagram following, and I wanted to automate the process.
                            From my research, I discovered that python could do the job.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            While learning python some of my most interesting projects were a random password generator and also,there was a
                            time when I helped my sister who was in the choir to make a program that accepts all the choir member name as an
                            input, and spit out a random name, that random name will be the one to lead the choirs special number the following
                            Sunday.
                        </p>
                    
                        <p>
                            A few weeks after I started learning Python, a friend of mine introduced me to web development and I immediately
                            became interested. I left python to learn Javascript.
                        </p>

                        <p> 
                            That was how my web development journey started, I attended a 3-months software engineering bootcamp at CITS in the
                            University Of Lagos. Since the completion of the bootcamp, I have been learning non-stop .
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            I am seeking full time role where I can help a company achieve their goals. And where can learn and grow while
                            helping the company achieve their goals.
